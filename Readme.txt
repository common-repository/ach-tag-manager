== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Google Analytics 4 property? =

Google Analytics 4 (formerly known as "App + Web") is a new kind of property, with different reports than what you're used to seeing in Universal Analytics properties.  One advantage of a Google Analytics 4 property is that you can use it for a website, an app, or both a website and app together. Universal Analytics properties only support websites.
